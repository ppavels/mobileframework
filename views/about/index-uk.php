<font color=#04B4AE>Hey Ladies!  I&#8217;m Leslie, a 25 year old country-turned-city-girl&#8230; and I love it!  Ever since I bought my iPhone I have become so tech savvy I don&#8217;t know what I would do without it!  It is so great to be out and about and still have the ability to go online and share all the great stuff I find with you!</p>
<p>I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family, and of course spending time with my dog Chazz!  He's grown quite a bit since this photo was taken, but I still think it is super cute!!  </p>
<p>I currently work full-time, but try spending as much of my free time as I can doing day trips to the beach, shopping and of course traveling!  I would have to say that my most memorable trip so far has been a family vacation to Hawaii, USA!   </p>
<p>Since joining this site I have saved all kinds of money and enjoyed some freebies too!  I especially like the offers I find for discounts at restaurants - I love trying new foods, especially when I am not the one cooking it! <img src="http://c454621.r21.cf2.rackcdn.com/womenfreebies.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />   </p>

I'm going into my second year of University and loving every second of it. I'm always searching the latest and greatest styles (and deals) and I love sharing them with you! Being a college student means I'm a pretty frugal shopper, so the freebies and coupons really help me out! I have two adorable dogs, Tucker and Tasha (that's a picture of Tucker - a Shih Tzu Maltese Mix) and they mean the world to me. I love going on walks with them and my boyfriend and stopping for Bubble Gum Ice Cream (yumm!). Happy bargain hunting!<br />
