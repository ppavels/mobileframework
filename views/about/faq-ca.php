  <p><strong>How does WomenFreebies.ca work?</strong></p>
<p>Think of us as your search engine for free stuff! We connect our readers with the most exciting contests, coupons and free samples available on the web. We don&#8217;t send out anything directly, so make sure you sign up for every offer that interests you!</p>
<p><strong>How do I get the freebies?</strong></p>
<p>When you see a free sample that you would like, click the link at the bottom of our blog post. It&#8217;ll usually say &#8220;Get Your Free Sample&#8221; or something along those lines. Clicking that link will take you to an external site with a form. Just fill out that form and submit it, and in the next eight weeks you can expect to find a free sample in your mail box.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I have to register to receive a free sample?</strong></p>
<p>Brands often ask for your address because they need to know where to send your free sample. It&#8217;s always different companies sending out free samples, so that means unfortunately you have to fill out a form each time.  By the way, sometimes brands ask you to answer a few questions before you sign up; this is because they want to know how they can improve their products to better suit your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Will you sell my information?</strong></p>
<p>No, we would never do that! In fact, WomenFreebies.ca doesn&#8217;t even ask for your address or phone number. Sometimes we link to free sample forms that collect this information, but that is only so they know where to send your free samples. We only write about brands that we love and trust <img src="http://womenfreebies.ca/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  If you&#8217;re concerned, we&#8217;d encourage you to check out our <a href="//signup.womenfreebies.ca/privacy.php" onclick="TINY.box.show({iframe:'//signup.womenfreebies.ca/privacy.php',boxid:'frameless',width:940,height:650,fixed:true,maskid:'blackmask',maskopacity:40}); return false;">privacy policy</a>, along with the privacy policies of any companies you may be requesting free samples from.  </p>
<p><strong>How do your Reply &#038; Win contests work?</strong></p>
<p>In every newsletter, we give readers the chance to win gift cards just for replying to our email! We ask all kinds of questions, all you have to do is reply to sarah@womenfreebies.ca  with your answer. It&#8217;s that easy!</p>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t have a printer. Can I still use your coupons?</strong></p>
<p>For coupons that require a printer, I recommend stopping by your local library or print shop. You can get coupons for pennies a piece; that&#8217;s cheaper than most clipping services!</p>
<p><strong>Why is this freebie only available in certain provinces?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes companies want to test their product in a small geographic area before they launch it nationwide. Don&#8217;t worry though, we are always looking for great new offers and there are bound to be many similar freebies available in your neighbourhood soon.</p>
<p><strong>It says &#8220;there are no more freebies available&#8221;; when will there be more?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, lots of people want free stuff! That means that popular freebies often run out quickly. Depending on the sample, there may be more released the next day, but this it not always the case. Make sure you check your email first thing in the morning to ensure that you are among the first to hear about a free sample. Also, check our home page often because we blog about free samples all day long.</p>
<p><strong>Is it WomenFreebies.ca that sends the free samples and coupons?</strong></p>
<p>No, what we do is share all the amazing freebies and deals that we find online with our fans!</p>
<p><strong>I can't enter my postal code or phone number, why?</strong></p>
<p>Try adding a space in the postal code or removing the space. IE: K1V 6B9 or K1V6B9<br />
Same thing with your phone number &#8211; options include:<br />
(123)456-7891<br />
123-456-7891<br />
1234567891</p>
<p><strong>Will my inbox be full of spam?</strong></p>
<p>I find  that when I give my email out, I am only submitting it to brands I would like to be contacted by. They usually give their followers first crack at the samples and contests. If you are concerned about giving out your email I would suggest that you create an address  that you will use exclusively for contests, coupon-ing, samples etc. Also remember to look for the boxes that say 'please click here if you would prefer not to receive the latest offers'.</p>
<p><strong>I clicked on a free sample link and it's taking me to a different offer / error page, why?</strong></p>
<p>If the brand's site is experiencing technical difficulties, you may be directed to an error message. We do our very best to re-direct you to a similar freebie. In the case that you get a blank page, feel free to post a comment letting us know or try again later.</p>
