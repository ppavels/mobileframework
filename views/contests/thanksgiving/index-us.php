        <p>From November 24 - December 1, 2014, we will be placing Thanksgiving Pies on every single page of our blog, WomanFreebies.com. Not all of them are winners though. There's a turkey on the loose and he's gobbling pies as fast as we hide them. The number of winning Thanksgiving Pies we will hide and when we will hide them varies from day-to-day.  Although the winning pies are completely random, this sage advice is worth following. The best way to be in the know is to like our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter, follow us on Pinterest, and most importantly, read our newsletter. This is where you will find Mystery Prize hints! Just because you don't find a winning Thanksgiving Pie in the morning, doesn't mean you won't find one later on that same day. The name of the game is patience. </p>

       <p>There will be Thanksgiving Pies on every single page, all over our site. You will definitely see them. When you find the pie, give it a click. This will display the message inside & let you know if you have won or not. If you find that tricky turkey - you have won! Luck plays a huge part in who will find a winning Thanksgiving Pie with the turkey inside. Playing the Gobble Gobble Giveaway smart won't hurt though. Here's some tips: each page on WomanFreebies.com has different odds of winning so don't just keep refreshing the same page over and over! Open the Thanksgiving Pies on the newer blog posts for your best odds in winning (the first 40 pages have the best odds). As you may be aware - you can win on ANY and EVERY page. We've tried our best to make this giveaway convenient for everybody - you can find Thanksgiving Pies on any browser and even on our mobile site.</p>
