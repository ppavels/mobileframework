<p><span style="color: #F07000;"><strong>* What&#8217;s a Thanksgiving Pie? Where do I find a Thanksgiving Pie? What do I do when I find a Thanksgiving Pie? * </strong></span></p>
<p>A Thanksgiving Pie is an image that will appear on your screen. They are being hidden on every page on our site. <a href="http://womanfreebies.com/sweepstakes/bake-a-bone/"><strong>Click here</strong></a> to get to a blog post with a Thanksgiving Pie on it. When you see the Thanksgiving Pie (they are on <strong>EVERY</strong> page so you will see them), click on it and it will let you know if you have a winner (there will be a Turkey) or if you need to keep looking (there will be a feather). Winning Thanksgiving Pies will bring you to a form (with a Turkey) where you can enter your contact information. Make sure you fill in an email address you can check. <strong>DO NOT</strong> fill out your form more than once. <em>Duplicate entries will be void</em>. Your prize will be <strong>emailed</strong> to the address you provided within 48 hours. Share the news that you won a prize during our Gobble Gobble Giveaway with your friends and followers using the social buttons!</p>
<p><span style="color: #F07000;"><strong>* I can&#8217;t see any Thanksgiving Pies? * </strong></span></p>
<p>Try closing some of your windows, most likely you have too many open! Some pop-up blockers have been known to prevent Thanksgiving Pie from appearing too.</p>
<p><span style="color: #F07000;"><strong>* How do I keep missing the Turkey? I click on the Thanksgiving Pie right away? * </strong></span></p>
<p>When you find a winning Thanksgiving Pie it will display the Turkey and a form to fill out, otherwise you will get the &#8220;Sorry, you missed him&#8221; message.</p>
<p><span style="color: #F07000;"><strong>* How many Thanksgiving Pies are you hiding? How many Thanksgiving Pies are left today? When will you be adding more winning Thanksgiving Pies to the site? *</strong></span></p>
<p>All of the winning Thanksgiving Pies are hidden now. They are hidden on EVERY page. You saw the list of prizes that we have for you - all of them are available to be won at any time. We increase the odds of winning at certain announced times <a href="//signup.womanfreebies.com/?view=c"><strong>(signup for our newsletter for special hints)</strong></a>! Just because you don't find a winning Thanksgiving Pie in the morning, doesn't mean you won't find one later on that same day. The name of the game is <strong>patience</strong>. The best place to keep track of what we are giving away and when is on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WomanFreebies"><strong>Facebook page</strong></a>. We like to give our fans the chance to convince us that you want to see more winning Thanksgiving Pies, so be sure to LIKE our posts on Facebook if you want more prizes to be hidden. The number of winning Thanksgiving Pies varies, but there are lots to go around. There are <strong>always</strong> winning Thanksgiving Pies hidden. We have the site fully stocked.</p>
<p><span style="color: #F07000;"><strong>* Do the Thanksgiving Pies load instantly? Can I stay on one post and just refresh? *</strong></span></p>
<p>The Thanksgiving Pies load almost instantly, you simply need to look around for them. Looking around the page will give you time to read each post before clicking to see if you won. You can stay on a page and refresh, but I <em>wouldn't</em> recommend doing this because every post has different odds. This means if you're on a post that's less likely to have a winning Thanksgiving Pie, you are actually hurting your chances of finding a prize.</p>
<p><span style="color: #F07000;"><strong>* What if I click on a Thanksgiving Pie and the form doesn't load? What if I want another prize? *</strong></span></p>
<p>If you believe you have encountered a technical error, please take a <a href="http://www.take-a-screenshot.org/"><strong>screenshot</strong></a> or a photo of your screen and send it to â€‹thanksgiving@womanfreebies.com. Each winning Thanksgiving Pie is linked to one gift card only and has no redeemable cash value. Since we will be giving away thousands of prizes, we cannot accommodate requests to change prizes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #F07000;"><strong>* How many times can I win? Who's eligible to enter? *</strong></span></p>
<p>Only one major prize may be claimed per household per day. You can win as many gift cards as you can find. We reserve the right to block any users who use bugs, bots, viruses or any other unauthorized intervention to undermine the fairness of the promotion. The 2014 Gobble Gobble Giveaway is open only to legal residents of the fifty (50) <strong>United States</strong> (including District of Columbia) who are 16 years or older at the time of entry.</p>
<p><span style="color: #F07000;"><strong>* Should I use a certain browser? Is this contest available on your mobile site? *</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Any</strong> browser will work just fine - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Explorer, etc. Our contest is <strong>mobile friendly</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #F07000;"><strong>* Do the Thanksgiving Pies "move"? * </strong></span></p>
<p>The Thanksgiving Pies can be anywhere on our site. They will be in different spots on different pages. Once you have opened a page it won&#8217;t move until you click it! After 10 minutes the Thanksgiving Pie will time out and go back into the pot.</p>
