        <p>From April 1 - 20, 2014, we will be hiding Eggs on our blog pages (WomanFreebies.com, WomenFreebies.ca & WomenFreebies.co.uk). Big News - this year 
            <strong>we will be giving away a KitchenAid Mixer, an iPad mini & a Keurig EVERY DAY!</strong> This year is a little different from previous years. <br /><br />
            The first change we made is that there will be an <strong>Egg on EVERY page!</strong> The second change is that you will need to connect through Facebook in 
            order to hunt. If you don't have a Facebook account, you will need to make an <a href='<?php echo SITE_ROOT; ?>/?esignup=1'>
                <strong>Egg Hunt Account</strong></a> in order to participate. Don't worry - it's EASY! This is used for us to track any lost eggs you may have clicked on. The number of winning Eggs we will hide and when we will hide them varies from day-to-day - be sure to like our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter, follow us on Pinterest, and read our newsletter to stay in the know. Just because you don't find a winning Egg in the morning, doesn't mean you won't find one later on that same day. The name of the game is patience.</p>

           <h6>WheWhen you find AN EGG
it will look like this:</h6>
            <img src="<?php echo $this->pagedata->imagefolder;?>/easteregg/sample-.jpg" alt="" class="egg1"> </div>
          <div class="clm-2">

        </div>
       <p>There will be Eggs all over our site on every page. Look around on any page for a bit and when you find it give it a click. This will display the message inside & let you know if you have won or not. <strong>If you find the Bunny - you've won!</strong> Luck plays a huge part in who will find a winning Egg with a Bunny inside. Hunting smart won't hurt though. Each page on WomanFreebies.com, WomenFreebies.ca & WomenFreebies.co.uk has different odds of winning so don't just keep refreshing the same page over and over! * You must open Eggs on the blog for the Country you reside in. Americans must search on WomanFreebies.com. Canadians must search on WomenFreebies.ca. Brits must search on WomenFreebies.co.uk.

<br/><br/>Open Eggs found on the "newer" blog posts for the best odds to win (the first 40 pages have the best odds). We've made it convenient for you - open the Eggs on any browser and even on our mobile site.</p>
<p>If you find a winning Egg, claim your prize by clicking on the message from the Bunny and filling out the form. Don't stop there - <strong>you can win once per household per day.</strong></p>

 <p style="margin-top: 10px"><p>The Eggs should appear almost immediately, simply scroll around the page and find it. They can be anywhere on so have a look around! This will give you some time to read through our posts and take advantage of the great coupons, vouchers,  freebies, competitions, sweepstakes, giveaways and deals. A lot of people have reported winning in contests they entered while hunting during our annual Hunts so make sure to get in if you'd like to win.</p>
