            <p><span style="color: #6633ff;"><strong>* What's an Egg? Where do I find an Egg? What do I do when I find an Egg? * </strong></span></p>
<p>An Egg is an image that will appear on your screen. They are being hidden on every page on our site. <a href="http://womenfreebies.co.uk/competitions/myoffers-mini-cooper-one/"><strong>Start here</strong></a> to get to the next possible Egg. When you see one (they are on <strong>EVERY</strong> page so you will see them), click on it and it will let you know if you have a winner (there will be a BUNNY) or if you need to keep looking. Winning Eggs will bring you to a form (with a BUNNY) where you can enter your contact information. <strong>DO NOT</strong> fill out your form more than once. <em>Duplicate entries will be void</em>. Your prize will be mailed out within 15 business days to the address you provide. Share the news that you won a prize during our Egg Hunt with your friends and followers using the social buttons!</p>
<p><span style="color: #6633ff;"><strong>* I can&#8217;t see any Eggs? * </strong></span></p>
<p>Try closing some of your windows, most likely you have too many open! Some pop-up blockers have been known to prevent eggs from appearing too.</p>
<p><span style="color: #6633ff;"><strong>* How many Eggs are you hiding? How many Eggs are left today? When will you be adding more Eggs to the site? *</strong></span></p>
<p>We hide thousands of Eggs every single day. They are hidden on EVERY page. You saw the list of prizes that we have for you - any of them could be hidden at any time. We add new Eggs throughout the day! Just because you don't find a winning Egg in the morning, doesn't mean you won't find one later on that same day. The name of the game is <strong>patience</strong>. The best place to keep track of what we are giving away and when is on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WomenFreebies.co.uk"><strong>Facebook page</strong></a>. We like to give our fans the chance to convince us that you want more Eggs, so be sure to LIKE our posts on Facebook if you want more prizes to be hidden. The number of Eggs varies, but there are lots to go around. There are <strong>always</strong> Eggs hidden. We have the site fully stocked.</p>
<p><span style="color: #6633ff;"><strong>* Do the Eggs load instantly? Can I stay on one post and just refresh? *</strong></span><br />
<a href="http://womenfreebies.co.uk/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-54048" alt="&quot;Egg Hunt 2014&quot; FAQ" src="http://2100e1a9e06dae55bb89-52e2dd183304330879c990438a1130af.r83.cf2.rackcdn.com/womenfreebies.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wait-img.jpg" width="208" height="168" /></a><br />
The Eggs load almost instantly, you simply need to look around for them. Looking around the page will give you time to read each post before clicking the Egg. You can stay on a page and refresh, but I <em>wouldn't</em> recommend doing this because every post has different odds. This means if you're on a post that's less likely to have a winning Egg, you are actually hurting your chances of finding a prize.</p>
<p><span style="color: #6633ff;"><strong>* What if I click on a Egg and the form doesn't load? What if I want another prize? *</strong></span></p>
<p>If you believe you have encountered a technical error, please take a <a href="http://www.take-a-screenshot.org/"><strong>screenshot</strong></a> or a photo of your screen and send it to egghunt@womanfreebies.com. Each winning Egg is linked to one gift card only and has no redeemable cash value. Since we will be giving away thousands of prizes, we cannot accommodate requests to change prizes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #6633ff;"><strong>* How many times can I win? Who's eligible to enter? *</strong></span></p>
<p>There is a maximum of one win per household per day. Any <strong>US, UK or Canadian resident</strong> 16 or older is eligible for this contest. We reserve the right to block any users who use bugs, bots, viruses or any other unauthorized intervention to undermine the fairness of the promotion.</p>
<p><span style="color: #6633ff;"><strong>* Should I use a certain browser? Is this contest available on your mobile site? *</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Any</strong> browser will work just fine - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Explorer, etc. Our contest is <strong>mobile friendly</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #6633ff;"><strong>* Do the Eggs "move"? *</strong></span></p>
<p>The Eggs can be anywhere on our site. They will be in different spots on different pages. Once you have opened a page it won&#8217;t move until you click it! After 10 minutes the egg will time out and go back into the pot.</p>
<p><span style="color: #6633ff;"><strong>* The "Egg Hunt" ends on April 20, 2014 at 11:59 pm GMT. *</strong></span></p>
